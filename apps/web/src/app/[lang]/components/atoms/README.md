# Atoms

 typically refers to the smallest, most basic building block of a user interface. Atoms are reusable components that represent simple UI elements, such as buttons, input fields, checkboxes, icons, etc. They are the foundational components upon which more complex components are build

If atoms are the basic building blocks of matter, then the atoms of our interfaces serve as the foundational building blocks that comprise all our user interfaces. These atoms include basic HTML elements like form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that canâ€™t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.
