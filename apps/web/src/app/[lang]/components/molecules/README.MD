# Molecules

The number of atoms that make up a molecule varies depending on the specific molecule.

A molecule is a group of two or more atoms that are chemically bonded together. Some molecules, like diatomic molecules (e.g., O2, H2, N2), consist of only two atoms of the same element bonded together. Others, like water (H2O) or carbon dioxide (CO2), consist of multiple atoms of different elements bonded together.

For example:

- Water (H2O) molecule consists of 2 hydrogen (H) atoms and 1 oxygen (O) atom.
- Carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule consists of 1 carbon (C) atom and 2 oxygen (O) atoms.

So, the number of atoms in a molecule depends on the specific chemical formula of that molecule.

In interfaces, molecules are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button can join together to create a search form molecule.
